# MBTADepartureTimeGenerator


This program uses the MBTA v3 API to help a user find the next departing train for a particular stop on the MBTA T network. It will prompt the user for different info relating to routes, stops, etc. 


To run this program:
 
1. Navigate to the same directory that the files are located in. 
2. Run “python numerated_challenge.py” on the command-line. 


This program uses the requests library, so you will need to “pip install requests” if you don’t have the library. 

For testing, the unittest library is used, so you will need to “pip install unittest” if the library is not available to you.
